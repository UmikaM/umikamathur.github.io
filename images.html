       <h3>Eiffel Tower, Digital Image, 2018</h3>
       <p>I chose to glitch an image that I took of the Eiffel Tower when I traveled to Paris two years ago. During the time spent in this city, I fell in love with everything about it. I admired how there was history attached to every building or structure, and it was an interesting contrast from the Bay Area’s urban environment. I wanted to distort this image I took of the Eiffel Tower because I believe it would be interesting to change and manipulate a structure the whole world deems as perfect and famous for its shape and architecture. I named it the Eiffel Tower of Terror by combining the dark image of it that I
was trying to achieve, and the name of the Tower of Terror ride in Disneyland to further add to the image or persona I had originally envisioned for it.</p>

      <h3>Composite Image, Digital Image, 2018</h3>
      <p>I chose to use the images/location of Disneyland. For some reason, the first area that came to my mind when I thought of a location was Disneyland. It is an interesting location because it is widely known by many people, and I wanted to see what I could change it into. This place was an important part of my childhood, and I will always remember my visits to Disneyland growing up. I chose to create a video game type of collage, mixing certain aspects of Disneyland, with video game features/characteristics that I grew up playing with. Usually, the goal in many video games is to get at the highest level, which I represented with the real image of the castle. I also added different roller coasters to give it a hyper real, otherworldly effect. To continue with the video game theme, I added other images that are popular in the Super Mario games such as the blocks he jumps on, and the clouds beneath the castle to make it look as if it was floating. I chose to use a mixture of images from real life as well as video games to compare reality with video games. Many people use video games as a form of an escape from the world, which can often end up being someone else’s entirely different reality, so I wanted to bring these two interesting worlds together in order to enhance both their meanings. The placement of my images in this collage symbolize the level of “greatness” with each image. I made the castle float in the air, and made some roller coasters larger than others to indicate that I think they are both intimidating and in your face usually. The function of my image in my opinion, seems overall lighthearted and reminiscent of my childhood. I would choose to print the image large or use it as a screensaver.</p>

      <h3>Different Dimensions, Digital Images, 2018</h3>
      <p>For this project, I chose to create three composite images through Photoshop. My favorite form of creating art through technology is by using Photoshop and joining various images together to create one unique image. I admire Composite Art because it gives the artist the opportunity to completely use their imagination and create something completely different and “out of this world”. For these reasons, I decided to make my own composites and explore my mind to see what I could create.</p>

      <h3>Writer's Block, Digital Drawing, 2017</h3>
      <p>This digital drawing was done by using an app on the iPad. I was interested in learning new ways to create art in my free time and I discovered that I really enjoyed creating digital drawings such as this one.</p>

     <h3>The Florida Project, Digital Drawing, 2017</h3>
     <p>I created this alternate movie poster for the film, “The Florida Project”. After watching the movie, I was inspired by the cinematography and use of vibrant colors in the setting for this film, which encouraged me to draw my own version of a poster involving my perspective of the setting of this movie.</p>

     <h3>Surroundings, Digital Drawing, 2019</h3>
     <p>I drew this image by using an app on the iPad after observing my surroundings one day. I was interested in recreating my surrounding environment and seeing how I could adapt it as I was sketching it out and adding my own twist by using different and bright colors.</p>

     <h3>Portrait of a Dog, Digital Drawing, 2019</h3>
     <p>This is a portrait I drew of a dog, done on the iPad. I wanted to create something lighthearted and fun to draw during the process. I like to include vibrant colors in my drawings and make images that are unique, so I explored that in this image.</p>
