         <h3>Spinning in Circles, Interactive Net Art using p5.js, 2018</h3>
         <p>For this project in particular, I used a combination of code and techniques demonstrated previously in class to create my own interactive website with p5. Being new to coding, javascript, and the overall exciting world of Digital Media Art, I am very interested in creating an interactive aspect with the projects I create. I chose to use certain code, such as mouseX and mouseY, variables, and mousePressed along with a different changing background image for this assignment. The overall concept I was exploring for this project in particular was utilizing code to change what the viewer sees when they click on their mouse and drag it through the screen.

         <h3>Virtual Haunted House, Interactive Net Art, 2019</h3>
         <p>The title of this Net Art project is Virtual Haunted House. For this assignment, I wanted explore my creativity when it comes to coding. I always thought that haunted houses were interesting because you donâ€™t know what is about to happen next with every direction you choose to go in, so I created a similar experience to that through this project.

         <h3>Generation Z, Interactive Net Art, 2019</h3>
         <p>For this Net Art project, I dedicated it to my generation, known as Generation Z. There are so many interesting topics and subcultures that have been created through this generation. I gathered together as many relevant topics as I could for this project and found interesting articles to correspond with each topic that the viewer can click on and discuss them further.
