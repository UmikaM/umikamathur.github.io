          <h3>National Calzone Day, Interactive Net Art, 2018</h3>
          <p>The title of my Net Art project is National Calzone Day. Being new to creating net art, there were many different directions I could have explored for this project. Personally, a quality about the internet and media I have always loved and been fascinated by is gifs. Ever since they became popular (or since I started noticing them) in middle school, I have always wondered how they were made and I admired the simplicity of what they consist of. A few seconds of a video looped over again can add a different personality to what you are using it for. For my Net Art project, I wanted to figure out how to incorporate them in my website for comedic purposes. Along with this, gifs are somewhat an entire form of their own genre and entertainment. When I used to spend more time on Tumblr, (where gifs are extremely heavily used) I used to be able to look at gifs for as long as I possibly could because they were new and entertaining to me, and I believe that is what stemmed my interest in incorporating them in my Net Art project.

         <h3>Spinning in Circles, Interactive Net Art using p5.js, 2018</h3>
         <p>For this project in particular, I used a combination of code and techniques demonstrated previously in class to create my own interactive website with p5. Being new to coding, javascript, and the overall exciting world of Digital Media Art, I am very interested in creating an interactive aspect with the projects I create. I chose to use certain code, such as mouseX and mouseY, variables, and mousePressed along with a different changing background image for this assignment. The overall concept I was exploring for this project in particular was utilizing code to change what the viewer sees when they click on their mouse and drag it through the screen.

         <h3>Virtual Haunted House, Interactive Net Art, 2019</h3>
         <p>The title of this Net Art project is Virtual Haunted House. For this assignment, I wanted explore my creativity when it comes to coding. I always thought that haunted houses were interesting because you donâ€™t know what is about to happen next with every direction you choose to go in, so I created a similar experience to that through this project.

         <h3>Generation Z, Interactive Net Art, 2019</h3>
         <p>For this Net Art project, I dedicated it to my generation, known as Generation Z. There are so many interesting topics and subcultures that have been created through this generation. I gathered together as many relevant topics as I could for this project and found interesting articles to correspond with each topic that the viewer can click on and discuss them further.
